Title: Gene Set Omic Analysis (GSOA)

Description: From our manuscript: "Although in some cases
    individual genomic aberrations may drive disease development 
    in isolation, a complex interplay among multiple aberrations 
    is common. Accordingly, we developed Gene Set Omic Analysis 
    (GSOA), a bioinformatics tool that can evaluate multiple 
    types and combinations of omic data at the pathway level. 
    GSOA uses machine learning to identify dysregulated pathways 
    and improves upon other methods because of its ability to 
    decipher complex, multigene patterns."
